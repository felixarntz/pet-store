# Pet Store

Adds a pet store to your WordPress website. Example plugin for the Post Types Definitely library.

## Getting Started

After having installed and activated the plugin, you can easily add pets through the new interface which can be found under the new "Pets" menu item. You can also easily add new species by using the new "Species" taxonomy. It is recommended to add actual species as top-level terms while adding specific races as sub types to a general species.

## Requirements

You must have the [Post Types Definitely](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-types-definitely/) library installed in order for this plugin to do its job.

## Why?

This is an example plugin for Post Types Definitely, showing a possible use-case. While you can certainly use it as-is, it should mostly encourage you to modify it to your needs. The [Wiki for the plugin](https://github.com/felixarntz/post-types-definitely/wiki) provides you with more information on how everything works.
